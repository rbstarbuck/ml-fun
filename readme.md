This is the readme for the ML-Fun design team's project for performing action recognition of masonry workers using smartwatch accelerometer data.

The code is dependent on LibLinear 2.1 and the t-SNE Matlab implementation. It is expected that these are located in the root folder at "./liblinear-2.1" and "./tSNE_matlab", respectively.

 - To generate the feature examination plots shown in the paper, run "examine_features.m" - 
 - To generate the t-SNE feature aggregation plot, run "examine_features_tsne.m"
 - To generate the results data included in our paper, including the bias/variance analysis and final test results, run "bias_variance_subjects_test.m" in Matlab.

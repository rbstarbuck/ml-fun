Hi,

I just realised that it is not a good idea to release a third party library in our repo.
So I put it in our google drive folder.

Please replace this folder with the liblinear-2.1 in 445Team folder. Thanks!
I have compiled it twice so it should work on cean computer (windows x64) and mac x64.

Enjoy!

agenda:

choose several sets of fastest features with highest accuracies - from feature combinations text file
train hyperparameters on those features: choose sets of hyperparameters - implement in handle_wrapper_tester
->use svm template and look at training accuracy -> requires modification to work with handle_wrapper_tester
->use bias/variance analysis and look at results ->also requires modifications

Wrap up results and commentary in poster

BIAS VARIANCE SUBJECT TEST

abs_average_peak_handle, abs_std_handle, abs_mean_handle, = 0.739111
ADD RMS MEAN and run through pipeline
ADD PCA?
